# Tests
This folder is used to contain all the test setup and configurations, as well as the tests themselves. The tests are written using the **Vitest** testing framework.

## Testing structure
in every folder, there is a `tests` folder. This folder contains all the tests for the files in the parent folder. For example, the `src/controllers` folder contains all the controllers for the application. The `src/controllers/tests` folder contains all the tests for the controllers.
